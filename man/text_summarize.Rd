This function returns a DataFrame with total word count,
total sentence count, most common and least common word, average
word length, and average sentence length. Each information resides
in a separate column.
Takes in a string and returns a data.frame with one row and six columns.
First column contains the total word count of the string.
Second column contains the total number of sentences in \code{text}.
Third column contains a list of the most common words in \code{text}. If this returns a
list of length 1, there is only one most common word. If this
returns a list of length > 1, there are multiple words that appear
the most number of times in \code{text}.
Fourth column contains a list of the least common words in \code{text}.
If this returns a list of length 1, there is only one least common word.
If this returns a list of length > 1, there are multiple words that appear
the least number of times in \code{text}.
Fifth column contains the average word length in \code{text}.
Sixth column contains the average number of words in a sentence, in \code{text}.}
